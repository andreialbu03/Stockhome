                        <em>Note, all information presented below comes from source <a class="ref-links" href="../references.html#reference2">[2]</a></em>

                        <p>Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company that specializes in consumer electronics, software and online services. Apple is the largest information technology company by revenue (totaling US$365.8 billion in 2021) and, as of January 2021, it is the world's most valuable company, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="history" class="stock-h3">History</h3>
                        <p>Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a business partnership. The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak. To finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Bus, for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for US$500 (equivalent to $2,274 in 2020). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976. The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chipsâ€”a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer.</p>
                        <p>Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977, without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded Apple. Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of US$250,000 (equivalent to $1,067,683 in 2020) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple. During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="products" class="stock-h3">Products</h3>

                        <h4 class="important">iPhone</h4>
                        <p>The iPhone has a user interface built around a multi-touch screen, which at the time of its introduction was described as "revolutionary" and a "game-changer" for the mobile phone industry.

                        <p>iOS is one of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world alongside Android. The iPhone has generated large profits for the company, and is credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies. As of the end of 2021, the iPhone accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.</p>

                        <h4 class="important">Macintosh</h4>

Personal computers were Apple's original business line, but as of the end of 2021 they account for only about 10 percent of the company's revenue. The company is in the process of switching Mac computers from Intel processors to Apple silicon, a custom-designed system on a chip platform.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="important">iPad</h4>

                        <p>The iPad took the multi-touch user interface first introduced in the iPhone, and adapted it to a larger screen, marked for interaction with multimedia formats including newspapers, books, photos, videos, music, documents, video games, and most existing iPhone apps. Earlier generations of the iPad used the same iOS operating system as the company's smartphones before being split off in 2019.</p>
                        <p>As of September 2020, Apple has sold more than 500 million iPads, though sales peaked in 2013. However, the iPad remains the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2020, and accounted for nine percent of the company's revenue as of the end of 2021.</p>
